# store - designed and developed by Cameron Conway

The aim of this project is to demonstrate my design skills, and experiment with different colours and styles. My focus was to develop something that goes against the typical minimalist black and white designs that many online fashion brands (https://www.balenciaga.com/en-gb, https://www.chanel.com/gb/, https://www.dior.com/en_gb) go for and create something that is vibrant and friendly, while still being clean and structured.

## Technologies

The project is built using the frontend JavaScript library [React](https://reactjs.org/) the rest is standard CSS and vanilla JavaScript.
